The Lounge
=======

Overview
---------------
This is the company intranet for BIG Warranties. This application is designed to be the central place employees go to see news about the company, use various social features and access other applications. 

This application was written in C# .NET following the WebForms design structure. This was a solo project that I started from scratch and during the project I had to communicate with the directors and other heads of teams to make sure it was what they wanted.
