BIG Documentation
=======

Overview
---------------
BIG Documentation is an application that displays various project’s XML tags in a presentable format. When a programmer adds an XML tag to their project to describe anything from a class to a function, BIG Documentation will pick it up and display it in a nice format in the application. 

This application was a C# .NET project that follows the MVC design structure. This was a solo project however it was built on top of an unfinished foundation originally written by an ex-employee of BIG Warranties many years ago. 

As the only goal of this application was to document code, it was only available to the IT department.
