ClockLight
=======

Overview
---------------
ClockLight is a mobile game I am currently working on. It is being developed in Unity and will be released on iOS and Android in Summer 2017. To view the code for this game please contact me.

Description
---------------
This is a challenging, quick reflex, precision game where you must move the hands on a clock so that they align with specific points around the clock edge. 

Around the edge of the clock instead of numbers there are different coloured lights. These coloured lights around the edge will spawn at intervals that will get shorter as the player progresses. At the start of the game there will only be a maximum of 4 lights around the edge, increasing to 12 over time. 

There will be different modes of gameplay that the player can choose between, each differing slightly. On initial release, there will be 4 game modes, with more getting added after release. 

First off there is classic mode. At set intervals, two beads of light will spawn at the centre of the clock. One will move up the big hand of the clock and the other will move up the small hand of the clock. 

Once they reach the ends of their hands they will move to the edge of the clock where the hand is currently pointing at. The objective of the game is to line up the big hand and the small hand with a light around the edge of the clock that is the same colour as the bead of light moving up the hand. 

When it reaches the light bead at the edge of the clock the two light beads will then combine and disappear, which is known as a light match. If you try to combine two beads that are different in colour they will not disappear and will become a different colour. 

If there are 12 beads of light active around the edge of the clock for a period of ~1.5 seconds, it will be game over. 

The second mode is spinner mode. Spinner mode is exactly the same as classic mode except the lights around the edge will be slowly rotating clockwise or anticlockwise. This means the player will have to think about where the lights around the edge will be a few frames in the future. 

Thirdly there is alternate mode. This mode is exactly the same as classic mode except the lights in the middle won’t spawn in pairs. 

In classic mode one spawns at the base of the small hand and the big hand, however in alternate mode one will spawn on one hand then a second later another will spawn on the other hand. This means the player will have to be repositioning the hands a lot more often. 

Fourthly there is pulse mode. This mode is the most different from the other two. Unlike classic mode where the pair of lights spawn at intervals, in this mode the player gets to decide when to spawn the lights. To do this they must tap the centre of the clock, which will spawn the pair of lights. 

They can do this as fast as they want to (or as slow), however it will get more difficult the more light beads that they spawn. To make it even harder the colours that are spawned at the centre won’t necessarily match those around the edge so the player will need to learn how to discard colours.

There is also an in-game currency. The currency itself has no name but has the icon of an atom in game. These are gained whenever there is a successful light match around the edge of the clock. These are used to buy utilities, powerups or skins from the store.
