BIG Desk
=======

Overview
---------------
BIG Desk replaced BIG Warrantie's in house ticketing system and external email system. This application was written in C# .NET following the MVC design structure. This was a solo project that I started from scratch. 

The previous in house ticketing system, BugTracker .NET, was a 10+ year old, open source ticketing solution. It worked, but ultimately it was showing its age and needed a revamp. 

The previous external email system, Freshdesk, was an email system provided by another company that we paid for monthly and was decided to be unsuitable for what the company needed.
